# Sookyoung Park
I redesigned the [TripAdvisor website](https://www.tripadvisor.com) with an emphasis on creating engaging user experiences. In particular, I utilized CSS to implement hover effects that enhance the website's overall functionality. Furthermore, I employed a variety of layout styles in each section to create a unique and visually appealing design. My goal was to create a website that stands out and offers a distinct user experience.
